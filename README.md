# Heartbeat Clustering and Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for clustering and analyzing heartbeat patterns using unsupervised methods. The goal is to explore and cluster ECG signal segments to better understand heartbeat structure and potential anomalies.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this notebook, I apply clustering techniques to ECG heartbeat data to identify distinct heartbeat patterns and group similar signal segments. It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature extraction, clustering implementation, and results visualization, making it suitable as a practical example of **signal processing and unsupervised learning** workflows.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ECG signal segment extraction and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering for clustering  
- Application of clustering algorithms (e.g., k‑means / hierarchical)  
- Visualization of cluster results  
- Insights into heartbeat data patterns
