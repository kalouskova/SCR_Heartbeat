# Heartbeat Anomaly Detection

This repository contains the semestral project for NI-SCR focused on detecting anomalies in heartbeat data using machine learning and signal processing techniques.

The project implements **autoencoders**, **Euclidean distance**, and **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** methods to classify normal and abnormal heartbeats.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify abnormal heartbeats in ECG signals. Abnormal heartbeats are often indicative of **congestive heart failure (CHF)** or other cardiac conditions. The project applies:

- **Autoencoders** for reconstruction-based anomaly detection.
- **Euclidean distance** for simple similarity comparison.
- **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** for time-series alignment and anomaly scoring.

We evaluate the performance using **F1 score** and **confusion matrices**, focusing on correct detection of abnormal heartbeats.
